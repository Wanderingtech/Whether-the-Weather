# Whether-the-Weather
Weather Dashboard Wk6 HW
## Objectives
Create a weather page that shows specific information for the current day. Then the 5 day Forcast with different information.


Requires multiple API calls for the current day weather vs 5 day forcast and also UV index.


The app should allow storage of previous cities with the ability to click and load the previous city data. 

## Techonologies
This assignment was a build from the foundation up. I used Materialize CSS framework alongside my html. I also used JQuery, the Open Weather API, and MomentJS.

## Future Improvements
This is not the finished product. I have full confidence I can finish, but work took all my time this week. 

I am working on adding the weather characteristics to a list so they all appear in the current day card. 

I need to get my cities to save to an array to retrieve from later. 

I'm encouraged to have the working API for weather and able to successfully make calls. 
Also able to store to local storage. Now to just get it into the array in local storage. 

I will deploy with the published link becuase of resubmission later. Though it's not much yet.
